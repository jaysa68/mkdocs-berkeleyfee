Berkeley CSF's budget analysts act as student consultants to campus units that receive student registration fees. We also serve as student representatives on committees that manage referenda fee funding. At the end of the academic year, CSF members conduct interviews with employees and leaders of campus organizations, and formulate budget reports based on their findings.
