## Lower Sproul Plaza Fee
### $306.00

The Lower Sproul Plaza fee is continuing to fund the transformation of Lower Sproul Plaza into the vibrant, student-oriented space it is today. The project addressed physical deficiencies, added new facilities and services, and enhanced outdoor amenities. The revitalized Plaza offers 24-hour study spaces, multicultural community centers, performance venues, and more, fostering a more engaging student environment. It began in 2010 at a rate of $35 per semester and will periodically increase each year until it reaches its maximum of $396 in 2041, continuing until the outstanding debt is paid (estimated to be 2046).
