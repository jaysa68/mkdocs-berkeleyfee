title: Health Fee
---

## Background

The fee was originally established in 2005 by a student referendum vote to provide several key health services demanded by students at that time. Without the Health fee, implementing these would have resulted in more increased out-of-pocket costs for students: in particular, co-pays for primary and urgent care and SHIP premiums.

Many of these programs receive funding from HFAB to this day; however, the referendum emphasizes that health fee allocations should shift based on student demand. Services that might have been crucial for students five years ago may be less so now, while the need for a different program rapidly increased. The fee level may also need to be increased, or decreased, to match the needs of the current students who pay it.

## The Health Fee Advisory Board

To ensure these annual changes get made, the referendum established the Health Fee Advisory Board. HFAB is an oversight committee which works to ensure that the Health Fee dollars are spent effectively at the Tang Center. We meet in the Fall to set priorities for Health Fee spending and recommend fee levels for the upcoming academic year. Recently, HFAB members have fought for initiatives to improve mental health support for BIPOC students and hired additional nurse practitioners, medical assistants, and counselors to ensure students receive the services they need.

**Current Health Fee Funded Services**

- Primary Care
- Urgent Care + Lab, Radiology and Pharmacy to align with extended hours
- Mental Health Services
    - Counseling and Psychological Services
    - Psychiatry
    - Social Services
- Preventative Services
    - Health Promotion
- Ease of Use
    - Information technology (e.g., eTang patient portal)
    - Appointment making

Keep in mind that the Campus Health Care Fee is intended to “supplement but not supplant” the other sources of income for UHS (tuition, SHIP premiums, etc). Our objective is to keep the fee level as low as possible while still meeting student health needs.
