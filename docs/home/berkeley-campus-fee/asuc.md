## SUPERB Allocation


## Background

The Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC), is the officially recognized student association at the University of California, Berkeley. Known as one of the largest and most autonomous student organizations in the nation, the ASUC is an independent 501(c)3 non profit organization separate from University governance.

In addition to controlling funding for student clubs and organizations, providing resources and student programming, overseeing commercial activities and student services including the Cal Student Store and Lower Sproul Plaza in partnership with the ASUC Student Union, the ASUC advocates for students on a university, local, state, and national level and represents the student body on administrative campus committees.

ASUC Meetings are 1.5 hours long and are typically held every Wednesday in 412
Eshleman Hall in the Fall and Spring.
