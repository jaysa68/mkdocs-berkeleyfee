## Tuition

### The Cohort Model

You might have noticed that each of the undergraduate charts include the term "Cohort" in the title, while the graduate student charts do not.

For example, an undergraduate student who first enrolled in 2022-23 paid $5,964 in tuition and $588 in student services fees that initial year, and would still pay that amount for 2025-26. However, all graduate students pay $6,570 in tuition and $666 in Student Services fees for 2025-26, regardless of the year that they first enrolled.

## Additional Fees

These are additional fees which are not compulsory for all students every semester.
